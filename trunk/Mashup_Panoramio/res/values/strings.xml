this app is still in development, if you have any comments write an email to info@androidmashup.org\n
If you want to use the mashup! feature, you need to have at least another app installed with this feature. At the moment:\n
- 'FONMaps'\n
- 'OpenFONMaps'\n
support the feature. Check out the 'Mashup-Organizer' for other apps to come.
'Mashup-Radar' or the regular 'Radar' work great when you want to navigate to a fonspot after clicking on it\n
